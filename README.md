### Design

**Site Structure**

The website is a single-page website that contains only one HTML page - there are no additional pages. The website is divided into 5 main sections: (1) About Us; (2) Our Services; (3) Why Choose Us? (4) Reviews; and (5) Contact Us.

This provides a more continuous, clean, and intuitive user experience - removing unnecessary clutter and focussing the user’s attention on the most important content, enabling the user to make a decision and act on it. The user navigates to different areas of the website by clicking on navigation links in the navigation menu, or by scrolling down the page to different sections of content.

**Color Scheme**

TBC

**Typography**

The Neuton font is the title font used throughout the whole website. Serif is the fallback font.

The Lato font is the paragraph font used throughout the whole website. Sans-serif is the fallback font in case the title font is not being imported correctly. The Lato font is known for its round edges and the approachable warmth it gives to the reader.

The Bubblegum Sans font is the brand fron used in the navigation menu at the top of the site and at the bottom of the site in the footer. Cursive is the fallback font. Bubblegum Sans is described as an in-your-face font; thick, round, and as playful as a puppy.
