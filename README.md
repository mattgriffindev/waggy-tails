### Design

**Site Structure**

The website is a single-page website that contains only one HTML page - there are no additional pages. The website is divided into 5 main sections: (1) About Us; (2) Why Choose Us; (3) Our Services; (4) Reviews; and (5) Contact Us.

This provides a more continuous, clean, and intuitive user experience - removing unnecessary clutter and focussing the user’s attention on the most important content, enabling the user to make a decision and act on it. The user navigates to different areas of the website by clicking on navigation links in the navigation menu, or by scrolling down the page to different sections of content.

**Color Scheme**

**Typography**

The Nunito font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the main font is not being imported correctly. The Bubblegum Sans font is the font used for the company’s brand in the navigation menu at the top of the site. Bubblegum Sans is described as an in-your-face font; thick, round, and as playful as a puppy. It has been used sparingly to give the site an element of fun. Nunito is a more serious font that reigns in the Bubblegum Sans and keeps it grounded [(Saas Design)](https://www.saasdesign.io/amazing-font-pairings/ "SaaS Design").
